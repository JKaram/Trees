# Trees

Many of us on the journey to programmatic mastery have come across Abstract Data Types (ADTs). The familiar stacks, queues, linked lists, and nodes on which they operate, are quite easy to conceptualise; they are structured linearly with a distinct beginning and end. Trees on the other hand are represented hierarchically and do not have a distinct beginning and end. This feature makes them a welcomed addition to the ADT family, giving programmers an efficient means to represent hierarchical data. In fact, the very electronic device that you are viewing this article from utilises trees to organise its operating system (see figure 0). Figure 1 below is a labelled representation of a tree . At the top of the tree is the root node, this node has no parents, no incoming edges, and is used to calculate the depth of the tree (see resource [1] below for an overview of tree terminology). Parent and child nodes are a bit trickier, as they are relative terms; a node can be represented as both a parent and a child. In the figure below, node B is a child of node A (root) as well as a parent of node D and E. Node D and E are siblings for they share the same parent. Node H, I, J, F, and G are considered leaf nodes; the reason being, they do not have any children and end the sequence of subtree spawning.

While learning how to program we learn about functions, arrays, strings, integers, booleans .. etc.  Before learning programming I liked trees, they are colorfull and convert hamrfull carbon dioxide into air. Thats really cool! However after learning how to program I dislike trees. Why is something that is so familiar so hard to understand.

## What are Trees?

Trees on the surface are actually easy to understand. Trees represent hierarchy and can be traversed recusivley. Like a real tree we start at the root. The root node is the base to any tree,every node in a tree either has a child or is considered a leaf node (a node with no children). A root node is just like any node, in that it is part of a data structure which consists of one or more fields with links to other nodes and contains a data field; it simply happens to be the first node. Nodes are linked to thier parent or child.
