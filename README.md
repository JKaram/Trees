# Trees

While learning how to program we learn about functions, arrays, strings, integers, booleans, ... etc.  Before learning how to program I liked trees, they are colorfull and convert hamrfull carbon dioxide into air. Thats really cool! However after learning how to program I dislike trees. Why is something that is so familiar so hard to understand.

## What are Trees?

Trees on the surface are actually easy to understand. Trees represent hierarchy and can be traversed recusivley. Like a real tree we start at the root. The root node is the base to any tree,every node in a tree either has a child or is considered a leaf node (a node with no children). A root node is just like any node, in that it is part of a data structure which consists of one or more fields with links to other nodes and contains a data field; it simply happens to be the first node. Nodes are linked to thier parent or child.

Take this diagram for example. Node '2' is the root, and has two children. Node 7 has one parent Node '2' and three children Node '2', Node '10', and Node '6'.

Node '5', 11 , and 4 are considered leaf nodes.

## How to traverse a tree

So how do we traverse atree. An aray is easy to loop through, but how can one access the data they need if its scattered about. 

We use recursion.
